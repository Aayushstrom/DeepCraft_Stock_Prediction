# DeepCraft_Stock_Prediction

# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project aims to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It utilizes historical stock price data to train the model and provides predictions based on time series analysis.

## Overview

The program is built using Python and leverages popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. The main steps involved in this project are:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading the dataset and preprocessing it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data trends and visualizing important metrics.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating useful features, including lagged values and moving averages.
4. **Model Selection and Training**: Implementing an LSTM model to learn from the data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as RMSE.

## Requirements

Before running the program, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- keras

You can install the required libraries using pip:
